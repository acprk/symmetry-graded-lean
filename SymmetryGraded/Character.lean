  Character.lean

  Formal verification (Lean 4 + Mathlib) of the "Section 4 character-decomposition
  framework" for BGV bootstrapping (Asiacrypt paper), generalizing the order-four
  special case of `OrderFour.lean` to arbitrary order `r`.

  Everything is modelled at the *coefficient level*, exactly as in
  `OrderFour.lean`'s `order_four_filter_coeff`: a formal element `f = Σ c_k X^k`
  is represented by its coefficient sequence `c : ℕ → K`, and the substitution
  operator `T_A : X^k ↦ A^k X^k` acts on coefficients by `c_k ↦ A^k · c_k`.

  This file formalizes, with no unproved placeholders:

  * `pow_mod_order`
        For an order-`r` element `A` (`A ^ r = 1`, `r ≠ 0`), the power `A ^ k`
        depends only on `k mod r`.        (generalizes `OrderFour.pow_mod_four`)

  * `isotypic_eigenvalue`, `isotypic_action`
        (Theorem "Isotypic decomposition", coefficient form)
        `V = ⊕_{j=0}^{r-1} V_j` with `V_j = {f : T_A f = ω^j f}`.  Since
        `T_A (X^k) = A^k X^k = A^{k mod r} X^k`, the eigenvalue attached to the
        monomial `X^k` depends only on `k mod r`, so `X^k ∈ V_{k mod r}`.

  * `covariance_determined`, `covariance_consistency`, `covariance_dichotomy`
        (Proposition "Monomial support constraint")
        If `T_A f = ω^j f + h` (coefficient-wise `A^k c_k = ω^j c_k + h_k`), then
        for every `k` with `A^k ≠ ω^j` the coefficient is uniquely determined,
        `c_k = h_k / (A^k − ω^j)`; and where `A^k = ω^j` the relation forces the
        consistency condition `h_k = 0`, leaving `c_k` free.

/-! ## 2. Theorem "Isotypic decomposition" (coefficient / eigenvalue form)

The character-decomposition framework writes the ambient space as
`V = ⊕_{j=0}^{r-1} V_j`, where `V_j = {f : T_A f = ω^j f}` is the `ω^j`-eigenspace
of the substitution operator `T_A : X^k ↦ A^k X^k`.  Because `A` is a primitive
`r`-th root of unity (`A ^ r = 1`), we have `T_A (X^k) = A^k X^k = A^{k mod r} X^k`,
so the monomial `X^k` is an eigenvector whose eigenvalue depends only on `k mod r`;
hence `X^k ∈ V_{k mod r}`.  The two lemmas below make this precise at the level of
eigenvalues. -/
section Isotypic
variable {R : Type*} [CommRing R] {A : R}

/-- The eigenvalue `A ^ k` attached to the monomial `X^k` under `T_A` depends only
    on the residue `k mod r`.  Concretely, whenever `k ≡ l (mod r)` the two
    monomials `X^k` and `X^l` carry the *same* eigenvalue, so they lie in the same
    isotypic component `V_{k mod r}`.                (Theorem "Isotypic decomposition") -/

/-- Coefficient form of the isotypic action of `T_A : X^k ↦ A^k X^k`.  The operator
    scales the `k`-th coefficient by the eigenvalue `A ^ k`, which by `r`-periodicity
    equals `A ^ (k % r)`.  Thus `T_A` acts on the coefficient sequence `c` diagonally,
    with the eigenvalue at index `k` depending only on `k mod r`. -/

/-! ## 3. Proposition "Monomial support constraint"

Suppose the covariance relation `T_A f = ω^j f + h` holds, i.e. coefficient-wise
`A^k · c_k = ω^j · c_k + h_k` for every `k`.  Reading off the `k`-th coefficient,
this is `(A^k − ω^j)·c_k = h_k`.  There are two regimes:

  (i)  If `A^k ≠ ω^j` (`X^k` sits in a different isotypic component than the target
       `ω^j`), the coefficient is *uniquely determined*: `c_k = h_k / (A^k − ω^j)`.

  (ii) If `A^k = ω^j` (`X^k` is in the target component `V_j`), the relation forces
       the *consistency condition* `h_k = 0`, and `c_k` is left completely free.

    Where `A^k = ω^j` (the monomial `X^k` lies in the target isotypic component
    `V_j`), the covariance relation forces the consistency condition `h_k = 0`.
    The coefficient `c_k` itself is unconstrained (it is the free parameter of the
    eigenspace `V_j`). -/

  complementing `OrderFour.lean` (the Order-Four Character Filter) and
  `Character.lean` (the general order-`r` framework).  This file
  formalizes, with no unproved placeholders:

  * `card_v3`, `card_v3_mod`
        (Theorem "Tight term count", counting part)
        Among the exponents `k < |S_A| = 4q + 1` exactly
        `q = (|S_A| - 1)/4` satisfy `k ≡ 3 (mod 4)` — namely
        `3, 7, …, 4q - 1`.  (`|S_A| = (2B+1)²` is an odd square, hence
        `≡ 1 (mod 4)`, so this is exactly the paper's case.)

  * `support_card_le`, `term_count_bound`
        (Theorem "Tight term count", bound `|T| ≤ (|S_A| - 1)/4 + 1`)
        A coefficient sequence supported in `{1} ∪ {k ≡ 3 (mod 4)}` — the
        conclusion of the Order-Four Character Filter — has at most
        `q + 1` nonzero coefficients below `4q + 1`.  Chained with
        `OrderFour.order_four_filter_coeff`, this machine-checks the
        paper's term-count bound directly from the functional equation.

  * `encode_abs_le`, `encode_injective_int`
        (Parameter Admissibility Theorem, injectivity core)
        The digit encoding `(η, λ) ↦ ηA + λ` with `|η|, |λ| ≤ B` has
        absolute value at most `|A|·B + B`; hence if
        `2(|A|·B + B) < p`, two encodings that agree modulo `p` are
        already equal over `ℤ`.  This is the sufficiency direction of
        the admissibility condition (Definition 1).

  * `ratio_eq`, `ratio_lt_two`, `ratio_tendsto`
        (Complexity theorem, asymptotic part)
        The evaluation-cost ratio `2√d / (2√(d/4) + 4)` equals
        `2√d / (√d + 4)`, is `< 2` for every `d ≥ 0`, and tends to `2`
        as `d → ∞`: the order-four method asymptotically halves the
        number of non-constant multiplications, approaching the
        speedup factor `2` from below.

The paper's set of exponents is `{0, 1, …, |S_A| - 1}` with
`|S_A| = (2B+1)² = 4q + 1` (an odd square is `≡ 1 (mod 4)`).  The filter
passes the residue class `k ≡ 3 (mod 4)`, i.e. `3, 7, …, 4q - 1`:
exactly `q` exponents. -/

/-! ## 2. Parameter Admissibility — the injectivity core

Definition 1 requires the digit encoding `(η, λ) ↦ ηA + λ`,
`|η|, |λ| ≤ B`, to be injective modulo `p`.  The checkable arithmetic
core: every encoding lies in `[-(|A|B + B), |A|B + B]`, so as soon as
`2(|A|B + B) < p` two encodings that agree mod `p` differ by a multiple
of `p` of absolute value `< p`, hence are equal over `ℤ`. -/

/-! ## 3. Complexity theorem — the asymptotic evaluation-cost ratio

The baseline digit extraction costs `2√d` non-constant multiplications;
the order-four method costs `2√(d/4) + 4`.  Since
`2√(d/4) + 4 = √d + 4`, the cost ratio is `2√d/(√d + 4) = 2/(1 + 4/√d)`:
it is always below `2` and tends to `2` as the degree `d → ∞`. -/

  Formal verification (Lean 4 + Mathlib) of the algebraic core of

    "Order-Four Symmetry in BGV Bootstrapping:
     Faster Digit Extraction for Large Primes"

  This file formalizes, with no unproved placeholders, the results underpinning the
  paper's main (digit-extraction) contribution:

  * `sq_neg_one_pow_four`, `pow_mod_four`
        A² = -1 forces A⁴ = 1, i.e. A is an order-four element, and Aᵏ
        depends only on k mod 4.                       (order-four action)

  * `stability_pointwise`
        A·(hA + ℓ) = ℓA + (-h), i.e. multiplication by A is the quarter
        turn (h, ℓ) ↦ (ℓ, -h).           (Lemma "Support stability", core)

  * `filter_factor_eq_zero`, `filter_factor_ne_zero`, `filter_factor_zero_iff`
        Over a field of characteristic ≠ 2 with A² = -1,
             Aᵏ + A = 0  ↔  k ≡ 3 (mod 4).            (the "character filter")

  * `order_four_filter_coeff`  and  `order_four_filter`
        (Theorem "Order-Four Character Filter")
        The functional equation  P(AX) + A·P(X) = A·X  forces every
        coefficient cₖ with k ≠ 1 and k ≢ 3 (mod 4) to vanish, and c₁ = 1/2.

  * `factored_form`
        (Theorem "Factored evaluation form")
        Consequently  P = (1/2)·X + X³ · Q(X⁴)  for some Q.

    the coefficients at exponents `≡ 3 (mod 4)` are the free parameters
    (these are the coefficients `q_j = c_{4j+3}` of `Q`), and every other
    coefficient vanishes.  This is exactly the decomposition
